# tsconfig.json and next.config.ts might be needed by the build stage,
# but not necessarily in the final runtime image if using standalone.
# However, it's safer to include them in the build context and let the Dockerfile stages handle it.

# PNPM files (if any specific ones should be ignored beyond node_modules)
# pnpm-lock.yaml is needed, so don't ignore it.

# Files from root that might be in context if Docker build is run from root
# (adjust if build context is apps/web itself)
# ../.git
# ../node_modules
# etc. (assuming build context is apps/web)
